## Project Overview

The **News Intelligence Predictor** project leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to predict trends, events, and sentiments from news headlines and articles. By extracting insights from textual data, this tool aims to support real-time forecasting in various fields, including finance, politics, and public opinion. 

The ability to analyze news articles can provide a competitive edge in understanding market movements and public sentiment. This project uses advanced techniques to process and interpret large volumes of text, making it a valuable resource for analysts and decision-makers.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates several technologies and frameworks to achieve its goals:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Deep Learning**: Techniques used for model training and prediction.
- **NLP**: Natural Language Processing methods for text analysis.
- **TF-IDF**: A statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of words in a document.
- **HTML**: For rendering web interfaces.
- **Deep Neural Networks**: For advanced predictive modeling.

## Features

- **Real-time Prediction**: Analyze news articles and headlines in real-time.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment of news content (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Trend Forecasting**: Predict future trends based on historical data.
- **User-friendly API**: Access the functionality via a simple API.
- **Customizable Models**: Train models on your own datasets.

## Getting Started

To get started with the News Intelligence Predictor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kartav005/news-intelligence-predictor.git
   cd news-intelligence-predictor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Latest Release**:
   For the latest version, [download it here](https://github.com/kartav005/news-intelligence-predictor/releases) and execute the necessary files.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the News Intelligence Predictor.

1. **Start the API**:
   Run the following command to start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Access the API**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to access the interactive API documentation.

3. **Make Predictions**:
   Use the API to send news articles or headlines for analysis. The API will return predictions based on the input data.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is crucial for ensuring that the machine learning models work effectively. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Text Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stop words.
2. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
3. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Convert the cleaned text into numerical format using the TF-IDF method.

### Example Code for Preprocessing

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import re

def clean_text(text):
    text = re.sub(r'\W', ' ', text)
    text = text.lower()
    return text

def preprocess_data(data):
    cleaned_data = [clean_text(article) for article in data]
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(cleaned_data)
    return tfidf_matrix
```

## Model Training

Training the model involves selecting the right algorithms and hyperparameters. Here‚Äôs a basic overview of the process:

1. **Select Model**: Choose an appropriate machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, LSTM).
2. **Split Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Train the Model**: Fit the model on the training data.
4. **Evaluate Performance**: Assess the model‚Äôs accuracy using the testing data.

### Example Code for Training

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assume tfidf_matrix and labels are already defined
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(tfidf_matrix, labels, test_size=0.2)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```
